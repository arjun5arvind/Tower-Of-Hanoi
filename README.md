#Tower_Of_Hanoi Interactive Visualization using OpenGL.

REQUIREMENTS:- Preinstalled glut library.
 
INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:-

->To move a disk from one tower to another drag and drop the particular disk on desired tower.

->Once all disks are moved to third tower the game terminates by displaying total moves and time taken.

METHODOLOGY:-

->Line drawing Algorithm

->Circle drawing algorithm

->Ellipse drawing algorithm

->Polygon filling algorithm

->Tower of Hanoi algorithm



HOW WE USED IT:-

->Line drawing algorithm for drawing the towers.

->Circle and Ellipse drawing algorithm for drawing the disk.

->Polygon filling algorithm for filling colors in tower and disk.

->Tower of Hanoi algorithm for demonstrating the visualization with the help of user interactivity.
